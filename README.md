# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
A menu-driven C++ program that simulates major CPU scheduling algorithms â€” FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and MLFQ â€” with performance analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Implements 5 classical scheduling algorithms from Operating Systems.

Uses priority queues (heaps) for efficient selection in SJF and Priority Scheduling.

Uses FIFO queues for Round Robin and MLFQ time-sharing.

Reports completion time, turnaround time, waiting time, and their averages.

Menu-driven interface for testing multiple algorithms in one run.

ðŸ”¹ Data Structures & Algorithms Used

Sorting â†’ for FCFS ordering

Min-Heap (priority_queue) â†’ for SJF & Priority scheduling

FIFO Queue â†’ for RR & MLFQ

Greedy selection logic â†’ for minimizing turnaround/waiting times
